Hacker News in Mutt.

A simple script for fetching Hacker News and store them in a Unix mailbox file.
You can read the news later using mutt (or other e-mail client).

I have done the fetching part only and of course many things are missing.
Adding posting features is interesting; I guess you need to setup a custom
local MTA to do the job.

The API for fetching the news is taken from: http://hndroidapi.appspot.com

The code is free.
